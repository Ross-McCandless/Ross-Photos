            <p> Hi, my name is Ross McCandless and this is my first website. I'm an amatuer Photographer and Developer who figured combining the two interests would make for a good first website. <br>
            Majority of my pictures were taken with my Nikon D5200. The rest were taken from my Samsung Galaxy S5 or my Iphone 6s.</p>
